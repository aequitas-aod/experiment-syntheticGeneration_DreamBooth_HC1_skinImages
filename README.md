### Synthetic Generation of Skin Diseases Images via DreamBooth

In this repository we present the code used to generate synthetic images using
DreamBooth; the use case is a set of non-dermoscopic images of skin diseases
collected at the Sant'Orsola hospital in Bologna.

Due to their sensitivity, the real images are not included in the repository.
The synthetic images, instead, are made available.
